# AI Usage Report

---

## Overview
This project is a front-end personal portfolio website developed to showcase academic background, technical skills, and projects. It runs entirely on the client side using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with EmailJS for contact handling and the GitHub API for dynamic data.

The system is lightweight, responsive, and requires no backend or build tools.

## AI Tools Used

**ChatGPT**:
- Helped explain JavaScript concepts and API usage  
- Assisted with debugging logic and UI issues  

**Claude AI**:
- Performed code review (CSS & JS)  
- Suggested performance optimisations  
- Helped debug GitHub API display issue  
- Assisted in improving code structure and documentation

## Effective Use of AI

### 1. Code Review
AI identified redundant CSS rules and inefficient JavaScript logic, improving code quality, readability, and maintainability.

### 2. Performance Optimisation
Suggested improvements such as using `defer` for scripts, lazy loading images, and reducing unnecessary DOM operations.

### 3. Debugging
Helped diagnose a visibility issue in the GitHub section caused by interaction between animations and dynamically loaded content.

### 4. API Integration
Provided guidance on using the GitHub API, handling asynchronous data, sorting repositories, and managing errors.

### 5. Security Improvement
Introduced sanitisation of dynamically injected API data to reduce the risk of XSS when using `innerHTML`.

## Learning Outcomes

### HTML Concepts Learned:
- Semantic structure and accessibility (ARIA)
- Responsive layout design

### CSS Concepts Learned:
- CSS variables and theming  
- Avoiding redundant rules  
- Managing specificity and reducing misuse of `!important`  

### JavaScript Concepts Learned:
- API fetching and async handling  
- localStorage vs sessionStorage  
- DOM optimisation (caching elements)  
- IntersectionObserver behavior 
- State-based UI updates

## Benefits & Challenges

### Benefits
- Faster debugging and problem-solving  
- Improved code quality and performance  
- Better understanding of real-world issues  

### Challenge 1:
GitHub repositories were not visible due to a conflict between animations and dynamically loaded content.

### Challenge 2:
CSS conflicts caused by improper styling decisions, leading to inconsistent UI behavior.

### Challenge 3:
Project filtering and sorting logic interfered with each other, requiring better state management to ensure correct results.

### Challenge 4:
Form validation required handling multiple edge cases (empty fields, invalid email, async submission feedback).

## Responsible Use & Modifications

- All AI outputs were reviewed and tested  
- Code was modified to fit project requirements  
- No full features were copied directly without understanding    
- Understanding was prioritised over copying  

---

## Innovation

- Integrated live GitHub data dynamically  
- Combined filtering and sorting logic in one system  
- Added visitor personalization using localStorage  
- Implemented session-based visitor timer  
- Applied performance and security improvements

## Conclusion

AI was used as a support tool for debugging, optimisation, and learning. It improved development efficiency without replacing understanding or originality. The final project reflects independent implementation enhanced by AI-assisted refinement.
